Old list: 


When you solve a TODO, just put your name \
     and a star beside it (e.g. nneonneo-*TODOItem)
Higher Priority Level = More Important


Realmlist Server
    
Priority Level  Description
    1          Make it work on system tray icon.
    3     nneonneo-*"Session Expired" message on a successful login\
                      with a realmserver---how to fix?
    6     nneonneo-*"Logging in to Game Server..." stuck message\
                      if realm is selected from list (must have auto-connected to work)
    10 Spacey & Afinda*PHP Script (or similar) to manage accounts
                        Account format: name[32],password[32],sessionkey[40],lastlogin[4]
                        You may fill sessionkey and lastlogin with zeros. Name and password must\
                            be null-terminated.
    1               <optional>Password configuration so only trusted RealmServers can be listed
TownHall
    Priority Level  Description
    
    8        Queue System         
    999      Ye-*InfoData (or UpdateBlocks)
                        CPlayer::GetPlayerInfoData (Player.cpp) <--used to send information about your own character
                        CItem::GetItemInfoData (Item.cpp, ItemTemplate.cpp) <--used to send info about all your items (maybe disable this by destroying all your own items)
                        CCreature::GetCreatureInfoData (Creature.cpp) <--used to send info about creatures (disable by renaming data/spawns.sav)
                        CPlayer::GetOtherPlayerInfoData (Player.cpp) <--used to send info about other players, pretty much identical to GetPlayerInfoData (disable by not letting other players enter world)
                        **We can fix these one at a time by simply disabling all other factors (except GetPlayerInfoData!)                         CClient::AddKnown* and CPlayer::UpdateKnown* (Client.cpp, may not need updating)
                      With these, the emulator will be much closer to finishing.
                      What to do: The functions repeatedly add data to an UpdateBlock; you have to\
                          edit these data to bring it up to 1.8.0
                      If you need the packetlogging, set COMPRESSED_PLYR_PACKETS in Globals.h to 0.
    5               DBCs (especially Spell.dbc)
    8     nneonneo-*CHAR_ENUM (why does this fail)
    6     nneonneo-*Pressing "Enter World" does nothing (works on 1.6.1)
    6     nneonneo-*"Account Created" instead of "Character Created" message..probably opcodes
    1               MsgHandlers.cpp updates
    1               External Scripting support
    0               Database
Other
    x               Note: The .dsp and .dsw are nice, but I think the library libeay32.lib is missing from both...
    x               Note: For account creation, could you please add a change password option? Refer to create.py for ideas.
    x                    Note:Plz someone who are familliar with SVN write a manual how do i need to work
with my copy from the server? *nneonneo: Get TortoiseSVN and read the manual.
