Maybe she already is free.  Maybe she's just gathering strength before unleashing herself upon us.  If so, then you'll NEED the scroll!$B$B...too bad it's destroyed.

Hearing his vision of the Horde free of demonic influence, guided by the shamans, I returned.$B$BGornek will have further instructions for you.

Objectives=Study the tablets which tell of Ameth'Aran and of its fall, then return to Sentinel Tysha Moonblade in Darkshore.
Details=To the east you will find the ruins of Ameth'Aran. It is now inhabited by the restless spirits of the Highborne that once dwelt within its walls, but once it was a place where the servants of Azshara freely practiced their powerful magics.$b$bI was sent to explore the ruins and came across two large tablets, scrawled with the stories of Ameth'Aran and its fall. While I read the runes, I was accosted by the spirits, and fled.$b$bPlease, if you can, venture to the ruins and decipher the tablets in my place.

Details=The ruins of Bashal'Aran to the east are overrun with demonic minions. The sprites and satyrs that have taken up residence in the area feed upon the magical energies of the area, their powers growing from continued exposure.$b$bEven with that, I have noticed that there is one shrine they will not approach. On the western side of the ruins, atop a small bluff, a strange blue aura permeates... There must be an explanation to the demons' reluctance.$b$bI would like you to investigate it.

A seal binds me, and by examining the earpieces of the sprites and grells, I may find a trace of it.

Name=Moontouched Wildkin
Objectives=Collect 10 Moontouched Feathers from Winterspring, then return to Erelas Ambersky in Rut'theran Village.
Details=Wildkin feathers from the Hinterlands appear to contain traces of magical qualities. These powers... they don't seem to be wielded by the creatures, it's more like they are simply inherent to the species -- part of their very essence.$B$BDuring my studies, I heard that a large population of wildkin inhabit the snowy lands of Winterspring. Could these creatures have the same powers? Please help me find an answer, $N. Go to Winterspring and gather feathers that have dropped to the ground, then return to me.

Details=I had hoped Orendil's cure would save Relara, but I fear it only slowed the disease running through my child.  We must find more powerful medicine!  Thankfully, Orendil spoke to me of further remedies to try should his first one fail.$B$BElune's Tear is a type of stone that rests in only one place: the isle on Iris Lake, east of Astranaar.  Orendil said the stone will wash away corruption... please, $N, bring me Elune's Tear and pray it will end my child's sickness!

I believe it will take the power of a moonstone.$B$BWe used to gather moonstones at Fallen Sky Lake to the southeast... until the Shadethickets came.$B$BTheir leader, a Shadethicket Oracle, gathered up all the fallen moonstones and hordes them.  Now, you must retrieve a moonstone from the Oracle.$B$BAnd to do that, I fear that you must slay him.

Objectives=Scale the tower of Southwind Village and locate a means to stir the silithid hive into activity.  Bring back anything unusual you may uncover when doing so to Layo Starstrike at the Valor's Rest graveyard of Silithus.
Details=The hive needs to be addressed in Southwind Village, and I think I know a way to get at them.  It's been my experience that the silithid hives are very sensitive to their environment; this explains their attacks when hearing the death wails of the spirits.$B$BThe silithid are strongest in the tower - the one with the mass of wasps circling it.  Scale the tower and jostle the hive into activity.  Report back what you learn, but be careful!  If you uncover anything that might help, bring it to me.

When the Old Gods were banished, the elementals faded from our world and now only return at the bidding of powerful mages.$B$BThere are exceptions though. Some elementals were powerful enough to remain here on their own. One such elemental is Rok'Alim.$B$BTo test your strength, find Rok'Alim in Thousand Needles and slay him.

Unfortunately, Cozzle, the foreman out there, appears to be a little more clever than I gave him credit for.$b$bYou seem like you might have more luck finding the blueprints though. I know he keeps them in his house, but they're almost certainly under lock and key.

Details=It is strange that the pendant Marg stole was in the hands of common soldiers. Perhaps its owner was in disguise, or perhaps the soldiers themselves stole it!$B$BRegardless of which is true, this is a noble's pendant and we must discover its true owner if we are to unravel its mystery.$B$BTake the pendant to Zor Lonetree in Orgrimmar. He is well schooled in Alliance politics, and will know if this pendant has a history among the nobles of Stormwind.

Objectives=Find Commander Samaul in Dustwallow Marsh.
Details=The beginning of every month the Kul Tiras Marines all get paid and usually leave Theramore for somewhere else. A lot of them come here to womanize, carouse, and just have a good time. One of those groups I'd consider regulars here at the tavern, and I believe this Hendel is among them.$B$BCommander Samaul in Theramore would be able to help you find him if Hendel's still stationed there. He's completely loyal to Proudmoore, but if you drop Elling's name, he should help you out... discretely.

Details=There's work to be done in Desolace, $N. It's an atrocious place, befouled by centaur and other nasties.

Just head east if you enter from the Stonetalon Mountains. It's easy to miss, so be on the lookout.

Details=You take a few moments to figure out what pried the chest open, and you notice along the sides and top of the chest, long, deep scratches that reveal that something other than a man or giant took interest in it. The marks don't appear as if they were caused by dagger or sword.$B$BAfter going through the chest you find it to be completely empty.$B$BNot having another course of action, you close the chest and prepare to leave.

A tribe of naga, the Slitherblade, make that their home. I think that'd be our best bet.$B$BIf a scouting party went that far south, then they must've been pretty powerful.

Details=Valor, and all the virtues that go along with it, are like rare minerals: you must cherish them when you find them because of their value, but you must also take time to harvest them... refine them. When mixed together properly, a strong alloy is formed, sometimes unbreakable by even the most powerful blows.$B$BThis strength, your faith, your bravery, must be tested. You must learn to never lose faith and realize that with the power of the Light, you can overcome things that most others cannot.

Name=The Affray
Objectives=Kill Big Will, then speak to Klannoc Macleod on Fray Island.
Details=If you want to learn from me, then you must first pass The Affray.  It is a challenge we on Fray Island like to offer rising warriors who think they're tough, and if you can pass this test then I'll know you are.$B$BTo begin, walk into the middle of that crowd yonder and step on the grate.  That'll tell Twiggy Flathead you're ready, and he'll send challengers against you.$B$BBeat all the challengers and he'll call out Big Will.  Kill Big Will, and return to me in the time we allow.

Details=When demons of the Legion fall out of favor, their spirits are imprisoned within orbs and distributed to their mages and warlocks.$b$bMany were carried by their servants in Azeroth.

The other, larger piece, was possessed by a wizard in Shadowfang Keep. Find them and I can reform it.

Details=It was lost, but there's some idea as to where it might be found.$B$B There was only one copy ever made and it was vandalized at some point, a large portion of it ripped from the binding. Rumor has it that it somehow passed into the hands of the centaur of Thousand Needles.$B$B The rest was lost off the coast west of Southshore, where it was to be transported to Menethil Harbor by boat. It never arrived.$B$B In exchange for this knowledge, all I ask is that if you find it, bring it to me to see.

Objectives=Retrieve the Moldy Tome and Tattered Manuscript for Jorah Annison in the Undercity.
Details=Ah! I see that you are a warlock of similar tastes to mine. Indeed, acquiring the Tome of the Cabal is a worthy aspiration. Did you know that it was once held within the walls of Lordaeron? It was vandalized though, almost half its pages removed. Who would commit such a heinous act?$b$bThat half is lost, though rumor says that it fell into the hands of the centaur of the Thousand Needles.$b$bThe rest of the text was to be transferred to Ironforge, but was lost in transit on the coast west of Southshore.

Objectives=Explore the Ruins of Solarsal and investigate the presence of the naga there.
Details=To our south are the Ruins of Solarsal; this is an area that far pre-dates modern times.  We explored the ruins initially and found nothing of note; as such, we left it in peace.$B$BVery recently, the Hatecrest naga have occupied these ruins in alarming numbers.  At first, we considered it as the precursor for an attack.  Though that threat is still possible, we believe there might be something else going on.$B$BGo there, explore the ruins, and look for anything that stands out to you. Good luck, $n.

Details=The best course of action at this point is to assume that, regardless of what the naga are up to, they will eventually move to secure the island for their own.  We need to take aggressive steps to counter that threat before it is too late.$B$BBring me ten Hatecrest Scales that are in good condition; it should be obvious to you how to acquire them.  You'll cut your teeth on the naga for the first time, and we'll have a weakened naga presence on Sardor Isle - both are prospects that play to our advantage.

[Quest 3449]
Name=Arcane Runes
Objectives=Using the Drawing Kit, make rubbings of the Rune of Beth'Amara, the Rune of Jin'yael, the Rune of Markri, and the Rune of Sael'hai before heading to the small island off of the southern peninsula of Azshara and signaling Pilot Xiggs Fuselighter to pick them up.
Details=Magic was once as revered as Elune herself to some elves. Some of their most powerful mages created runes and tablets citing rules of the arcane and insights into their findings. They would leave these for all to ponder in public places.$B$BI would very much like rubbings of these runes from the Ruins of Eldarath. I have a kit for you to make the rubbings with, but it will be up to you to find them. Be careful though, the Explorer's League isn't the only one interested in Eldarath.

Objectives=Speak to Xiggs Fuselighter in Ironforge.
Details=I want the rubbings delivered to my tower, but there's no need to have you go all the way there. I'll just have them air-lifted out of Azshara.$B$BXiggs Fuselighter owes me a favor or two and will be in the area soon--he's signed on to patrol the coast. Speak to him before you leave. He can give you a flare gun to signal him with. When you have the rubbings, just head to wherever he tells you and then give them to him so he can get them to my tower safely. He should be in the hangar in the Military Ward.

Our schemata allow us to make devices that control the world around us; the manual you read covered this.$B$B The manual also covered our ages old oath of secrecy on our schemata. Once you become a gnome engineer, that's that. There is no access to goblin engineering at all.$B$B If you still want to become a gnome engineer, sign this document pledging life-long secrecy and speak with me again. Think about it carefully, $N.

Objectives=Bring 1 Lesser Nether Essence to Arathandris Silversky in Mulgore.
Details=The power of a disenchanted magical item is felt by the essence it creates. I've devised a way to turn raw essence used by enchanters into a suitable reagent for creating Cenarion plant salve. You don't need a Cenarion beacon for this; any suitably disenchanted item that yields lesser nether essences will work.$b$bI just need a single lesser nether essence; in exchange, I will give you Cenarion plant salves. The essence is extremely potent - a little definitely goes a long way!

Objectives=Now that Raschal's last known whereabouts have been discovered, continue your search for him or his remains in the Writhing Deep. According to the note, it is located to the south of the Woodpaw gnoll camps.
Details=Inside the backpacks are two items: the first is a parcel of goods that was bound for Thalanaar, and the second is a note hastily penned to an unknown reader.$B$BThe note tells of discovering insidious bug-like creatures south of the gnoll camps in a place called the Writhing Deep. The author felt the need to investigate it personally, as though it was a serious threat to all of Feralas. The note is signed, "Raschal of Feathermoon".$B$BIt would seem that you have located where Raschal ultimately went.

Name=Chasing A-Me 01
Objectives=Find a Mithril Casing and return to A-Me 01 in Un'Goro Crater.
Details=A little further investigation shows a panel that slides open. Clearly written above some wiring is the statement, "Replace Mithril Casing And Turn Power Off Then On."$B$BTaking a moment to replace the panel, you wonder if it'll be that simple to fix A-Me 01 and get her back to Karna Remtravel near Marshall's Refuge.$B$BOnly trying it will tell.

CompleteText=You remove the panel from A-Me 01's back yet again and carefully remove the old mithril casing that seems to have burnt out. The new one slides into place easily. The only thing left to do, assuming the mithril casing was the problem, is to flip the switch to the "Off" position, and then back to the "On" position.
IncompleteText=The panel in which the mithril casing goes is still closed shut. The rest of A-Me 01 remains inert.

Details=This will be the most difficult part because there is some complexity to the plan. To the north of here, you will find a small trail into the mountains. It was here I saw Lar'korwi last.

Perhaps this creature was driven to the shoreline by unknown beings rather than beaching itself as some of the other remains suggested.  Powerful Greymist murlocs have made the carcass of this creature their current home.$B$BIn the carriage, you find a box with strange markings on it

Details=You find a corpse of a sea turtle that had beached itself on the coast of Darkshore some time ago.  It has been picked nearly clean by Greymist murlocs, the very ones who now have encamped themselves around the creature's remains.  Still, there appear to be some suitable samples left on the creature's remains that Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine might be able to make use of.

Objectives=Take the Infus Emerald and use it on one of the Infernals found in Desolace. After successful, bring the Infus Emerald and the Imprisoned Infernal Spirit back to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens.
Details=So, you have chosen to capture the soul of an infernal, good. Take this emerald--with it, you will be able to capture the creature's soul. It works very similar to spells you already know: when the creature is close to dying, use the gem and it should do the rest of the work for you. I would suggest going to Desolace and trying your hand at any of the infernals there. Those should do nicely. After you're successful, take both the captured spirit and your emerald to Menara.

Objectives=Proceed to the Scarlet Crusade's base camp between Felstone Field and Dalson's Tears and destroy their command tent.$B$BPlace the Scourge banner at the camp, and then return to High Executor Derrington at the Bulwark, Western Plaguelands.
Details=Before Andorhal, we must tackle the advancing Scarlet Crusade menace from Hearthglen.  They've made camp between Felstone Field and Dalson's Tears, making us risk conflict against both the Scourge and the Crusade at once.$B$BMy plan is to play them off of each other by sending you to destroy the command tent they've set up; use some Flame in a Bottle from this box of incendiaries.  Once razed, plant this Scourge banner by the tent.  With some luck, they'll ignore us and focus on the Scourge for vengeance.

Details=To learn tribal leatherworking demands an understanding of how primal nature truly is; I know that you have already mastered the art of making wild leather armor, and I am willing to complete your training.$B$BKnow this, $C: by choosing this path you agree never to learn dragonscale or elemental leatherworking; there is only room for practice of one of the three arts. Furthermore, bring to me the finest samples of your wild leather armor. From there, we will begin your mastery.

Name=The Scourge Cauldrons
Objectives=Speak with Shadow Priestess Vandis at the Bulwark, Western Plaguelands.
Details=Within the lands of former Lordaeron are eight cauldrons - four in the west, and four more entrenched in the east.  These cauldrons spew poisons into the air, propagating the plague throughout the land for the Scourge.$B$BThe necromantic might of Kel'Thuzad is too strong to outright shut down these cauldrons, but we think we might have a way to subvert them to our advantage.  My second, Shadow Priestess Vandis, will be your point on this assignment; she'll continue the briefing from here.

Objectives=Go to Felstone Field in Western Plaguelands to locate and defeat the Cauldron Lord present there.  It may have a key that will allow access to the cauldron.  You must have the Empty Felstone Field Bottle with you to secure a sample of the poisons used inside the cauldron.
Details=Of the four cauldrons in the Western Plaguelands, the one at Felstone Field may be the easiest one to gain access to.  The Scourge have greener troops positioned here, though they should not be underestimated.$B$BGo to Felstone Field, due east of here and northwest of Andorhal, and engage the cauldron lord there.  On it is a key that will unlock access to the cauldron.  When unlocked, use this bottle to get a sample of the cauldron's toxins; we'll need it for study in developing a counter agent.

If we are able to pump out enough of it into the air, we might be able to weaken all the Scourge present here.$b$bThis will no doubt be an ongoing ordeal; we will need to continually hit these cauldrons and introduce our reagents into their mix. Still, if we can keep it up, we will have a huge advantage over Scourge when the time comes for battle!

Details=One of the plague cauldrons is located in the field of a former farmhouse now referred to as Dalson's Tears.  No tears will be shed this day, $c; we must strike at this cauldron and gain access to it!$B$BGo to Dalson's Tears, almost due north of Andorhal, and eliminate the cauldron lord there.

CompleteText=Ah, there is plenty in here for study. Well done, $N!$b$bFor now, the next step is in our hands. We'll need to produce a list of reagents that, when combined with what is already in the cauldron, will act as its counter.$b$bThe only way we will be able to introduce this is by placing the reagents into the cauldron directly. Apothecary Dithers will have more information on that, so be sure to speak with him as soon as possible.
IncompleteText=We know that each cauldron employs a different mix of reagents to generate its plague-inducing toxin; likewise, we know that we will need to develop a counter agent that is unique for each cauldron. Your sample from Dalson's Tears will be the key to figure out that cauldron's distinct reagent requirement.

IncompleteText=A Reliquary of Purity is an artifact unto itself. Few were ever made, and almost all of them were thought to have been lost over time.$b$bI admit I have known about the one in Southwind for a little while now. Honestly, with the rising turmoil in Silithus, I thought to keep our secrets just that - a secret. To poke and prod would only cause suspicions of our enemies to rise.$b$bAlas, the time for complacency is at an end, especially with the situation in Eldre'Thalas.

[Quest 5535]
Name=Spiritual Unrest
Objectives=Destroy 6 Highborne Apparitions and 6 Highborne Lichlings before returning to Loh'atu in Azshara.
Details=Long ago, the Highborne were some of the most powerful students of the arcane the night elves ever produced. The corruption that comes along with such studies caused much harm to night elf society and greatly affected all of Azeroth... as I'm sure you well know.$B$BI promised the Sentinels that I would release the spirits from their mortal bonds as I find them. If you would do the same, then I am sure I can reward you some.$B$BThe spirits haunt the Shadowsong Shrine to the northeast of here.

Details=The satyr, a disfigured, evil aspect of the night elves, now infect the sacred lands once traveled by Cenarius. I cannot speak for the night elves when it comes to all the atrocities those demonic creatures have committed, but I have sworn an oath to the Earthmother to aid the elves in ridding the land of such a nuisance.$B$BI am sure you would prove yourself if you aided me in purging them.$B$BNortheast of here, you can find the Haldarr clan.

Details=The key to Scholomance is called a Skeleton Key.  It must be forged from the remains of a skeleton - several actually - and hardened by only the strongest of metals within a suitable mold.  A signet of power from a being who naturally can open the portal to Scholomance will make the key ultimately function.$B$BFirst thing's first though, $N.  We'll need skeletal fragments for the key's forging.  Skeletons inside Andorhal should yield what we need, but the ones outside the walls might work too.

Details=What? Really? You want to know more? But you've already done so much for me, $N. I couldn't possibly ask you to enter Hearthglen itself on my behalf.$B$BAre you sure, $N? Hearthglen is much more dangerous than the Pass--I cannot provide you any protection  or even information about what you might face.$B$BWell, if you really are willing to help, then enter the town and find a high place to gain a good view of the town. From there you can gauge their numbers and report them back to me. But be careful....

Objectives=Grazle wants you to prove yourself by killing 7 Deadwood Warriors, 7 Deadwood Pathfinders, and 7 Deadwood Gardeners.
Details=The Timbermaw are the only furbolg tribe to escape the corruption. However, many other races kill furbolg blindly now, without bothering to see if they are friend or foe. For this reason, the Timbermaw furbolg trust very few.$B$BAre you interested in proving yourself? Drive back the corrupted Deadwood tribe and we may one day consider you an ally. You'll find the Deadwood warriors, pathfinders and gardeners to the south.

Objectives=Use the Aspect of Neptulon on poisoned elementals of Eastern Plaguelands.  Bring 12 Discordant Bracers and the Aspect of Neptulon to Duke Hydraxis in Azshara.
Details=A force of elemental scouts was sent to the eastern plaguelands of Lordaeron, and the disease of that place twisted and infected them.  The Waterlords cannot allow this affront to our purity!$B$BTake this vial.  In it is a quantity of one aspect of Neptulon.  If used on the plagued elementals it will fight the poison within their bodies and cure them!  But their inner conflict will drive them into a surging madness.$B$BDefeat the discordant surges and bring me their bracers of binding.

Details=There's plenty to do here still, but I think taking this back to the Circle for analysis is key. Trust me - the work will still be here once this is all said and done. If it's a journal inside this sticky chitin, then the Circle would finally have a window into the past!$B$B Take this to the Circle's archivist in Nighthaven.

I've only heard very hushed rumblings - which I guess aren't all that hushed when you think about it - about the horrors that are going on out there. Couple that with my lack of pleasure for anything bug-like, and you've got the recipe for me needing to stay here with the books!
IncompleteText=Why, hello there! Hrmm...$b$bLet me be a little honest with you, friend... you smell a bit ripe. Whiffy, one might say. Now I'm not making a personal assailment of your being. I'm just saying... in the future, you may want to freshen up a little after coming in from the field. It will make those first impressions a little more positively impressionable!$b$bAnyhoo... what can I do for you?

As soon as I find out what it is, and if it's indeed a book, I'd be happy to share that information with you.$B$B In the meantime, I'd check in with the den mother of this little bear camp, Rabine.

Nowadays, it seems as though others have turned the legend of this season of renewal into something that helps to sell candies and presents.$b$bIt's no surprise that Furmund is bitter about that sort of change. He and other tauren like him cling to our past like a banner of war. While I think a little celebration is always good, it is important to remember the origins of the Feast.

Details=Gifts, treats, presents... bah, I say!$B$B Those goblins pollute the true meaning of this season - the Feast of Winter Veil. This is a time of renewal; the land slumbers under a blanket of snow brought forth by Greatfather Winter, who is NOT the bumbling fool over there in the red suit!$B$B If you're interested in learning what the Feast is all about for yourself, ask Historian Karnik at the Explorer's League.

CompleteText=The Feast of Winter Veil, you say? Alas, in times past it held a more substantial meaning to us dwarves. Nowadays, it seems as though others have turned the legend of Greatfather Winter into something that helps to sell candies and presents.$b$bIt's no surprise that Goli is bitter about that sort of change. He and other dwarves like him cling to our past like a banner of war. While I think a little celebration is always good, it is important to remember the origins of the Feast.

Be warned, a Heated Ancient Blade will not remain heated forever - time is of the essence. The last step before returning to me is to slay the beast and drive the Heated Ancient Blade into her corpse. Do this and Quel'Serrar will be yours.
Details=Take the unfired ancient blade to the lair of Onyxia and engage her in battle. Some trickery must be utilized for the heating of the blade. While in combat, she will surely try to incinerate you with her fiery breath. You must plant the unfired ancient blade nearby and hope that the fiery breath heats the blade. If you live beyond this, pick up the now heated ancient blade and finish off the dragon. Plunge the heated ancient blade into her smoldering corpse to fashion the treated ancient blade.
